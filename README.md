# Player Communication System

**PlayerCommunicationSystem** is a Java console application that facilitates communication between two players. It establishes a client-server architecture where one player acts as the initiator and sends messages to the other player, who acts as the recipient and replies with a modified message.

## Packages

The application is organized into the following packages:

### client

- **Client**: Represents a client that connects to a server and communicates with it. It is the superclass for InitiatorPlayer and RecipientPlayer classes.

+ **InitiatorPlayer**: Represents the initiator player client. It sends messages to the server and receives modified messages from the recipient player.

* **RecipientPlayer**: Represents the recipient player client. It connects to the server, sends auto-generated messages, and listens for messages from the server.

### handler

- **ClientHandler**: Handles communication with a connected client. It receives messages from the client and broadcasts them to other connected clients.

### message behavior

- **MessageBehavior**: An abstract class representing the behavior of a message in client-server communication. It provides common functionality for sending and receiving messages to/from the server.

- **ClientGeneratedMessage**: Extends MessageBehavior and represents a message behavior where the client generates messages. It allows the client to send messages to the server and receive messages from the server.

- **AutoGeneratedMessage**: Extends MessageBehavior and represents a message behavior where messages are automatically generated by the client. It allows the client to send messages to the server and receive messages from the server.

### server

- **Server**: Represents a server that accepts client connections and handles communication with them.

### util

- **Constants**: Stores constant values used in the messaging application. These constants provide centralized access to important values throughout the application.

### Usage

1. Create two instances of the InitiatorPlayer and RecipientPlayer classes.

2. The initiator player sends a message to the recipient player.

3. Upon receiving a message, the recipient player replies with a modified message containing the received message concatenated with a counter.

4. The program gracefully finalizes after the initiator player has sent 10 messages and received back 10 messages.
